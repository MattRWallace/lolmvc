# Learn or Light Model View Controller
## Simply Powerful


LMVC, is meant to be a framework you can wrap your mind around.
It's primary purpose is to facilitate learning MVC by doing,
but could also make a nice base framework for a real app.

This project got it's start as a fork of PunyMVC, and really, this project
is still just starting. There is no release as of yet. However, that will change soon.

**Requirements: A web-server running PHP 5.4.X**

*MIT License, same as PunyMVC.*
