LMVC, Learn or Light Model View Controller, is meant to be a simple starter
MVC framework. It's primary purpose is to facilitate learning MVC by doing,
but could also make a nice base framework for a real app.

This project got it's start as a fork of PunyMVC, and really, this project
is still just starting. There is no release as of yet, it is still mostly
PunyMVC code. However, that will change soon.

Requirements: A web-server running PHP 5.3.6+
